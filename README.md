# Tandem

Built using Ruby version 2.7.1

To run, clone the tandem_code_challenge.rb file to a folder. Save down the question database json file in the same folder as the trivia challenge.

Before running the program, make sure RubyGems is installed along with tty-prompt (documentation found here https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt).

Since this was built as a CLI, once everything is installed, open the terminal window and open the tandem_code_challenge.rb file and you will be able to dominate the office trivia circuit in no time!

Press Control-C at any time if you wish to exit the game in progress.

Good luck!
